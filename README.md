Intro to R Data and Markdown Files

This repository contains the material for the introduction to R course due to be held on 5th May 2020.

It is provided open source, although if you are not attending the course we would recomment following Hadley Wickham's book 'R for Data Science' instead: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
